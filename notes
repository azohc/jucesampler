  TODOS:
add bottom section with knobs to edit sample start, end.
maybe another section to visualize the chop zoomed up -> make MiniThumbnail class

separate autochop threshold section with "Auto Chop" label and slider. also label method toggler


  EXTRAS:
click close to one of the selection times (boundaries of selection) to drag selection
chop amount preview that listens to threshold
mini thumbnail class
